Description for my project is :  This project is a fully responsive and animated front-end UI for an E-Learning Platform designed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript. The platform consists of multiple interactive and user-friendly pages such as:

Home Page – Clean landing page with animated headers and sections.

Dashboard – Displays student progress, enrolled courses, and activities.

Courses Page – Lists all available courses in card format.

Course Detail Page – Embeds video lessons, course overviews, and a “Mark as Completed” feature.

Contact Page – Includes a styled contact form for user queries.

Progress Tracker – Uses localStorage to track and display completed courses dynamically.

The project emphasizes modern UI/UX principles, smooth transitions, and animations for an engaging user experience. It is ideal for showcasing front-end skills and can be extended to integrate with backend or learning management systems in the future.
